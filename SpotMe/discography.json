I Am Mariah.\"\nPlease don't judge me for such a simplistic title...\nC'mon!! I was only 3 1/2 haha\nIt was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself\nWith the purity of a child's heart, before it was ever broken\n\nI've kept this drawing private for so long\nBut because this album is a reflection\nOf some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today\nI've decided to share it with those of you\nWho actually care and have been here for me through it all\nBeen through a lot, but I've always known Me... I am Mariah\nAlong the way, there have been a couple of nicknames\n(Mimi)\nAnd I've inadvertently embodied many personas\n(Butterfly)\n\nLately, they've been calling me\nThe Elusive Chanteuse\n(I like it)",
